# ISBDS Project Template: Supervised machine learning with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn

This project involves developing machine learning (ML) models with a dataset of clinical data related to Parkinson's Disease. The ML should be employed as a tool justified by overall medical and data science aims. Accordingly, results should be presented for interpretation in the biomedical domain.
