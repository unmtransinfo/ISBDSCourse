# ISBDS Project Template: Virtual Screening

The overall task, in the context of early stage drug discovery, is to model the bioactivity of a dataset of lead candidate molecules against the receptor sites of the following proteins: 
ERα (estrogen receptor alpha)
ERγ (estrogen receptor gamma)
AR (androgen receptor)

Target Based Virtual Screening (TBVS) may be achieved via docking, using OpenEye Docking, or AutoDock, or other packages. For an example test set, use a list of molecules  from PubChem that are similar to estradiol. 

Ligand Based Virtual Screening (LBVS) typically involves similarity searching using a known active ligand. Numerous online, standalone, free and commercial packages are available. 

Presentation of results should include graphical representations of binding, and analysis of the molecular interactions. The final report should be interpretable by pharmaceutical scientists concerned with drug discovery for disease areas related to these protein targets.
