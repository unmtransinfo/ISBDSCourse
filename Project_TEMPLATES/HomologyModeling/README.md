# ISBDS Project Template: Homology Modeling

For 3D molecular modeling of proteins for which no experimental
structure exists, homology modeling provides an alternative by
leveraging the known structure of a protein with similar sequence.

This project involves 4OH-Tamoxifen, a widely prescribed breast
cancer drug, and known anti-estrogen, which binds Estrogen Receptor alpha
(ERalpha), a nuclear receptor (NR), and GPR30, a G-protein coupled receptor
(GPCR). Specialized software is used to dock the ligand into the
receptor site, and to visualize and model the protein-ligand
binding interactions.
